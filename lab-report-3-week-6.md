## Streamlining ssh Configuration
We first opened our terminal where we typed ```cd .ssh``` to go into our ```.ssh```  files. We then used the ```vim```command to make a new file called ```"config"``` where we typed in our ssh username and host. We saved and exited the new file by pressing esc key then inputting ```":wq!"```. At that point, all we needed to do was type in ```"ssh ieng6"``` into the command line, and it automatically connects us to the other server.

## Setup Github Access from ieng6

### Public Key on Github
First we needed to get our ssh public key. So in order to do that you first need to go to your terminal, type in ```cd .ssh``` and then ```ls.``` If any of the files named: ```id_rsa.pub, id_ecdsa.pub, id_ed25519.pub``` are there; then just type ```pbcopy<~/.ssh/(filename)``` to copy it. Mine was ```pbcopy<~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub```. Note that the ones with ```.pub``` are the public SSH keys.
Then go to Github page from there go to settings-> SSH and GPG keys-->click on the green "New SSH key" button. It will then ask you for the title(which can be anything), and the actual key itself, that is what you just copied.

## Copy whole directories with scp -r
We can use scp to copy a directory(represented by .) to the remote server. We also have to give a name of the directory we want it to copy into on the remote server:
```"$ scp -r . cs15lsp22@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/markdown-parse"```
The ```"-r"``` option tells ```"scp"``` to work recursively. The ```"."``` is the source, and is the current directory. The ```"~/markdown-parse"``` tells scp to create the markdown-parse directory on the remote server (if it doesnâ€™t exist), and then copy the contents of this directory recursively there.
If we do this, then we can log into the server with ```"ssh"``` and see all of our files there in a
directory called markdown-parse:
